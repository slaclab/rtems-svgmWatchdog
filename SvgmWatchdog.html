<h1>A Watchdog Driver for RTEMS</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>Some embedded computer systems implement a watchdog timer
in hardware. The watchdog, when enabled, resets the board upon expiration.
(Note that early versions of VGM boards may lack this feature). The hardware
watchdog is implemented using one of the four timers (#3) present in the
OpenPIC interrupt controller (SVGM). On the MVME5500 and MVME6100 boards
the "Discovery" host bridge features a watchdog and on the uC5282 the Coldfire
MCF5282 CPU provides a watchdog and several other timers.</p>

<p>The driver described on this page initializes the watchdog timer
(compile-time configurable timeout) and starts a 'watchdog task' to
periodically 'pet' (reset) the watchdog timer. The scheduling priority for
the task is set at driver initialization and should be carefully chosen.</p>

<p>The driver also implements an RPC service for remotely watching and/or
resetting the target board.</p>

<p>The watchdog driver runs on vxWorks (deprecated/no longer supported) or RTEMS
(a test version also runs on various flavours of Unix), the RPC client on Linux, Solaris or other
Unices.</p>

<h2>Starting the Driver</h2>

<p>The watchdog driver (along with makefiles and the host-side 'client'
program) is available in CVS (SSRL Repository  -- $CVSROOT/drivers/svgmWatchdog).
After building and linking the driver (either statically or as a loadable module) into the
system, the driver must be initialized/started. The generic 'system'
startup script already loads the driver but does not start it, however (to
avoid interference of the watchdog task with the user application).</p>

<p>The watchdog is started by calling</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><code>wdStart(watchdog_task_priority)</code></p>
</blockquote>

<p>e.g. from a startup script. The watchdog may be halted (and the watchdog
task terminated) using the</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><code>wdStop()</code></p>
</blockquote>

<p>command. (CEXP NOTE: the driver is automatically stopped when unloading by
a module finalizer. It is <em>not</em>automatically started by the module
initializer, however.)</p>

<h2>Choosing a Proper Watchdog Priority</h2>

<p>Choosing the watchdog task priority is a tradeoff. It is desirable to set
the priority as low as possible since this will catch runaway tasks. OTOH,
too low a priority may result in spurious resets if higher prioritized tasks
need the CPU for longer than the watchdog expiration (compile-time default:
1.2seconds) - cexp module loading or IOC initialization are examples for
quite lengthy operations. In any case, the watchdog priority should be lower
than any real-time critical task's. Note that the watchdog task also runs an
RPC service (described below).</p>

<p>The problem of choosing too high a priority occurs when e.g. a networking
task runs away or a deadlock occurs while the watchdog task still is
operational. In these cases, control over the remote CPU may be lost unless
'remote watching' as described in the following section is used.</p>

<h2>Using "Remote Watching"</h2>

<p>Using the watchdog driver's RPC service functionality in combination with
a host-side client program '<code>wdclnt</code>', permanent control over a
target computer can be asserted. After a <em>connection</em> has been
established between <code>wdclnt</code> and the target watchdog RPC server,
the server (i.e. the watchdog driver) requires the client to send periodic
'software pet RPCs' (compile-time default: 5 seconds) and enforces a hardware
reset if these do not occur. Hence, any event leading to a loss of the RPC
connection (target crash or deadlock but also a broken network cable or a
host crash) eventually results in a target reset. Note that it is possible to
disconnect from the RPC server, thus leaving the "remote watching" mode. The
<code>wdclnt</code> program transparently connects when starting up and
disconnects upon exit.</p>

<p>While "remote watching" is very useful for development, it is probably not
desirable to use this mode during extended periods of time on production
targets.</p>

<h2>Using "Remote Reset"</h2>

<p>A target board can be remotely reset (using the <code>wdclnt</code> program)
either by suspending a connected <code>wdclnt</code> (for more than 5
seconds) or by letting it issue a special "reset" RPC (using the
'<code>-r</code>' command line option) which is also recognized by the
server.</p>

<h2>uC5282 Note</h2>

<p>Unfortunately, the hardware watchdog timer built into the MCF5282 has
the "feature" that it is enabled by default after CPU reset and that
it can only be disabled but not re-enabled again. Since the uC5282 firmware
disables the watchdog during boot-up the watchdog timer is essentially
useless.</p>

<p>However, with a little help from the motherboard designer, another hardware
timer can be employed as a watchdog.</p>

<p>Currently, the driver supports
using any one of the 4 DMA timers. Hence, a wire must be routed
(on the motherboard) from one of the DMA timer's <code>DTOUT</code> pins
to system reset (pin 98, <code>#MR</code> of the soDIMM connector).
<code>DTOUT #0</code> and <code>DTOUT #1</code> are at
pins 71 and 73 of the soDIMM connector, respectively (confusingly, Arcturus label these
pins "port C" whereas the MCF5282 manual uses the term "port TD").</p>

<p>By default, the driver uses DMA timer #0 as the watchdog. This assignment
is configurable, however, by means of a global variable <code>uC5282WatchdogType</code>.
Currently, the types <code>0x00</code> ("real" watchdog) and <code>0x10</code>
(DMA timer) are recognized. The timer "instance" is added to the type: e.g.,
in order to use DMA timer 2 <code>uC5282WatchdogType</code> would have
to be set to <code>0x12</code> (e.g., from a Cexp script) prior to calling
<code>wdStart(&lt;pri&gt;)</code>.</p>

<p>
<i>Note: without a wire from <code>DTOUT</code> to <code>MR</code> (reset)
the DMA timer watchdog does not work.

<h2>The <code>wdclnt</code> Program MAN Page</h2>

<h3>NAME</h3>

<p><code><strong>wdclnt</strong></code> - SVGM watchdog client program</p>

<h3>SYNOPSIS</h3>

<p><code><strong>wdclnt</strong></code> [options] <em>target</em></p>

<h3>DESCRIPTION</h3>

<p><strong><code>wdclnt</code></strong> establishes a connection to the
watchdog RPC server running on the <em>target</em>. It issues periodic 'PET'
RPCs while connected. <strong><code>wdclnt</code></strong> may be terminated
by sending it a SIGINT signal which will terminate the connection; SIGUSR1
causes <strong><code>wdclnt</code></strong> to issue a RESET request to the
target.</p>
